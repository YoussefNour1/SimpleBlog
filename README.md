## ‚ú® Key Features

This platform is packed with features designed for a rich user experience and robust administrative control.

### üè° Dynamic User Experience
- **Interactive Homepage:** A dynamic "magazine-style" landing page featuring a "Hero" section for the latest post, a swipeable carousel for recent articles (powered by Swiper.js), and a section for popular categories.
- **Intelligent Search:** A robust search functionality integrated directly into the main blog page, supporting live filtering and full pagination of search results.
- **Rich Text Editor:** A WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE) is integrated for an intuitive post-writing experience, allowing for easy formatting like bold, italics, lists, and headings.
- **üåç Multi-Language Post Support:** The blog is designed to handle both Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR) content seamlessly.

### üöÄ Real-time Notification System (SignalR)
A complete, real-time notification system to keep users engaged.
- **In-App Bell Icon:** A notification bell in the navbar alerts users to new activity with a dynamic counter for unread notifications.
- **Real-time Toast Popups:** Instant, non-intrusive toast popups appear when a user receives a new notification.
- **Interactive Dropdown with Infinite Scroll:** The notification list features **Infinite Scroll**, allowing users to browse their entire notification history seamlessly.
- **Smart "Mark as Read" & Data Integrity:** Notifications are marked as read upon click, and deleting a comment automatically removes its associated notification, keeping the system clean and up-to-date in real-time.

### üîê Authentication & Authorization (ASP.NET Core Identity)
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Distinct roles (`Admin`, `Author`, `User`) with granular permissions.
- **Secure CRUD Operations:** Users can only edit or delete their own content, while Admins have full override privileges.
- **Custom User Profiles:** Users have a `DisplayName` and a `ProfileImagePath`.
- **Admin Control Panel:** A secure dashboard for admins to manage user accounts and assign roles.
